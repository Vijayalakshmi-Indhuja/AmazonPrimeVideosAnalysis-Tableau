# ANALYSIS ON AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS USING TABLEAU

Analyzing Amazon Prime Video using Tableau can provide valuable insights into various aspects of the platform, such as user engagement, content performance, and customer behavior. Here's an example of how you could approach analyzing Amazon Prime Video using Tableau:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data related to Amazon Prime Video. This may include user data, content data, streaming metrics, customer reviews, and any other data sources that can provide insights into the platform's performance.

2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. This involves tasks such as handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating relationships between different datasets.

3. **Identify Key Metrics**: Determine the key metrics you want to analyze. These could include the number of subscribers, viewing patterns, popular content genres, customer ratings, and user engagement metrics like average watch time or the number of sessions per user.

4. **Create Visualizations**: Use Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities to create insightful charts, graphs, and dashboards. Some potential visualizations could include:

   - Time-based visualizations: Plot the number of new subscribers over time, compare the viewing patterns across different days or months, or track changes in user engagement metrics over time.
   
   - Content performance: Analyze the popularity of different content genres or specific movies/TV shows. Create visualizations to show user ratings, reviews, and viewership trends for various content categories.
   
   - User behavior: Explore user behavior patterns, such as the most common devices used for streaming, average viewing duration, or the most-watched content by specific user segments.

   - Geographical analysis: Use maps to visualize the distribution of Prime Video users geographically or analyze regional variations in content preferences.

5. **Dashboard Creation**: Combine multiple visualizations into interactive dashboards that provide a comprehensive overview of Amazon Prime Video's performance. Dashboards can help you identify correlations, trends, and patterns across different metrics.

6. **Data Exploration and Insights**: Explore the visualizations and analyze the data to derive actionable insights. Look for trends, patterns, and anomalies that can provide insights into user preferences, content performance, and opportunities for improvement.

7. **Sharing and Collaboration**: Share the Tableau dashboards with relevant stakeholders, such as product managers, marketing teams, or executives. Collaborate with others to gain additional insights and make data-driven decisions based on the analysis.

## Basic Approach :

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Download the dataset you mentioned from the provided Kaggle link and ensure it is in a structured format like CSV or Excel. If needed, perform any necessary data cleaning and transformation steps to make it suitable for analysis.

2. **Connect Data to Tableau**: Open Tableau and connect to the dataset you've prepared by selecting the appropriate data source option (CSV, Excel, etc.). Import the dataset into Tableau and verify that the data fields are correctly recognized.

3. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Start exploring the dataset by dragging and dropping fields onto the Tableau canvas. Create various visualizations to analyze the data and gain insights. Here are a few examples:

   - For the "Top 15 ratings," you can create a bar chart or a treemap to display the highest-rated shows based on user ratings.
   - To analyze the "Shows by type," you can create a pie chart or a stacked bar chart to show the distribution of shows by their type (movies, TV shows, etc.).
   - To identify the "Top 10 genres," you can create a bar chart or a horizontal stacked bar chart to visualize the most popular genres based on the number of shows.
   - For "Total shows by country," you can use a map visualization to show the geographic distribution of shows by country.
   - To analyze "Shows by release year and type," you can create a line chart or a stacked area chart to track the number of shows released over time, categorized by their type.

4. **Export as packaged workbook**: Once you have created your visualizations and dashboards, you can export them as a packaged workbook (.twbx) file. This file will contain both the data and the visualizations, allowing others to view and interact with the analysis using Tableau.

5. **Publish the reports**: If you have access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, you can publish your reports there. This will enable users to access the reports through a web browser, collaborate, and explore the visualizations you've created.

## Result :

In conclusion, analyzing Amazon Prime Video using Tableau can provide valuable insights
into the streaming service's content library, user engagement, and viewer preferences. By
visualizing data related to genres, viewership patterns, user behavior, content
performance, and regional preferences, actionable recommendations can be derived to
optimize content selection, enhance user experience, and improve viewer engagement.
